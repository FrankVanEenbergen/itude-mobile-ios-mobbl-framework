# Writing Documentation #

Classes are documented in the `.h` files. Documentation sets can be generated
using [appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/).

Additional documentation like this document is generated from the files in the
`docs` directory. You can use [markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) 
for markup.

By appending `-template` to the filename of the documentation file, the file
is processed by the `appledoc` tool to resolve any cross-references you use.
For example, this page is generated from `docs/Writing
Documentation-template.txt`. You can insert references to class names like
MBDocument or to additional documentation pages like Layers.

To (re)generate the appledoc: 
1. open a command line
2. navigate to the "itude-mobile-ios-mobbl/src/xcode" folder in this project
3. execute the command "appledoc ." (without the quotes, with the full stop). The documentation is installed in your /Users/[YOUR NAME]/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets folder
4. in xcode select the menu Help->"Documentation and API reference" and look for "itude-mobile-ios-mobbl Documentation"
